Cassandra Cluster Admin by SÃ©bastien Giroux
===============================================
Cassandra Cluster Admin is a GUI tool to help people administrate their Apache Cassandra cluster.

If you're like me and used MySQL for a while (and still using it!), you get used to phpMyAdmin and its simple and easy to use user interface. I thought it would be nice to have a similar tool for Cassandra and I couldn't find any, so I build my own!

With Cassandra Cluster Admin, you can create/edit/drop keyspaces and column families, truncate a column family, create secondary indexes, display a row, browse data (get range slice), insert a row and much more!

Bug report and/or pull request are always welcome!

Supported actions
------------------------------------------------
* Keyspace manipulation (add/edit/drop)
* Column Family manipulation (add/edit/truncate/drop)
* Row manipulation on column family and super column family (insert/edit/remove)
* Basic data browser to navigate in the data of a column family
* Support Cassandra 0.8+ atomic counters
* Support management of multiple Cassandra clusters

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------
If you're under Windows, I suggest you install [EasyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org/) or [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html) for a quick WAMP setup install.

Once your Web server is setup, you copy all the files from the package you've just downloaded into a directory that can be accessed by a Web browser (ex: http://localhost/cassandra-cluster-admin). The server must have PHP installed (5.3+ recommended). Installing the Thrift PHP extension is also a good idea for performance (read "Thrift C extension" section below).

All configuration is in `include/conf.inc.php`:

If this Web server is accessible by everyone, you might want to password protect the application, so your data is secure. To do so, you can set `CCA_LOGIN_REQUIRED` to true and specify your desired username and password by altering `CCA_USERNAME` and `CCA_PASSWORD` respectivly.

If your Cassandra server is not running on localhost or if you have multiple Cassandra nodes/clusters, you have to alter the `$CASSANDRA_CLUSTERS` array. This application support multiple Cassandra Cluster so you can alter `$CASSANDRA_CLUSTERS` accordingly. More info is found in the configuration file about multi cluster configuration.

If you want to see JMX stats in Cassandra Cluster Admin, you will need to activate MX4J on all your Casandra nodes you want to see the JMX stats. Once this is done, if MX4J is not running on the default port (8081), you will also need to alter `MX4J_HTTP_ADAPTOR_PORT` in the configuration file of Cassandra Cluster Admin.

Thrift C extension
------------------------------------------------
If you're in a test environnement or just want to get started with Cassandra, I suggest you skip this step as it's for performance improvement only. No extra feature by installing this.

The C extension is crucial for phpcassa's performance.

You need to configure and make to be able to use the C extension.

	cd include/phpcassa/thrift/ext/thrift_protocol  
	phpize  
	./configure  
	make  
	sudo make install  

Add the following line to your php.ini file:

	extension=thrift_protocol.so


Disclaimer
------------------------------------------------
This software is still in beta so always be careful when using it on a production cluster. I won't take any responsability if for some reason this tool drops all your keyspaces and wipes all your data, although I really doubt it will happen =)
